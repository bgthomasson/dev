NOTES: STUDIO

FONTS: need some 'artsy' ones
Google:
serif: Lora. Merriweather. 
"quirky" 
Indie Flower isn't bad, leans feminine but most artists will be female-ish. 
Pacifico is like a teacher's writing. 
Kaushan is artsy, energetic. 

NOTE: I like Kaushan but there is lag connecting to Google server, so use local, 
or something else that'll speed things up. It's purely icing on the cake.
