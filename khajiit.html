<h2>Khajiit subspecies</h2>

<p>
In general it seems there are three major types: Elven, biped feline, and quadruped feline. 
The latter two are themselves divided into three groups by size. 
It seems often they are further subdivided into 16 to 20 types, but for the 
purposes of this I sought simplicity. 
For further details on the various kinds of Khajiit, as well as culture etc, 
<a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit">see this page.</a>
</p>

<p>
For obvious reasons all quadrupeds have zero skills in those that require 
opposable thumbs- Archery, Handcraft, One Handed, Two Handed, Smith. 
They can learn some alchemy from eating ingredients.
To make up for the lack of weapons, quads have higher Unarmed skill, 
as well as a bite attack. 
It is also worth noting that they do wear clothing, although obviously it 
requires some help to put on. They are sensitive to their bestial appearance and 
take pains to appear sentient, even with other Khajiit. 
</p>

<h3>Ohmes</h3>
<p>
resemble Bosmer (aside from the tail!) and so can 
disguise themselves more easily, unless they have unique tattoos. 
Being less bestial, they have more charisma to other races, but are shorter 
than average (about 5 feet) and thus less strong. 
An Ohmes character's back story is inclined to include diplomacy and trade 
amongst men and mer. 
</p>

<h3>Dagi</h3>
<p>
are a rare, small (3 to 4 feet) bipedal feline, native to the jungle where they live 
in treetops and treehouses. Dagi have an affinity for magic, and ride large 
quad Khajiit into battle slinging spells and casting buffs, so a 
Dagi character is suited best to stealth magic and unconventional tactics. 
Due to the heat and humidity of their home, natives of Tengmar Forest are 
habitually scantily dressed, which scandalizes conservative desert dwellers.
</p>

<h3>Suthay</h3>
<p>
are the common cat-men seen in Morrowind, and thus have base stats. 
They are inclined to be rogues, rangers, and other light to medium styles. 
Their fur ranges in color and pattern from tiger to leopard to cheetah. 
Most likely to have ancestors from MOrrowind as Dunmer preferred to enslave this type. 
</p>

<h3>Cathay</h3>
<p>
are similar to Suthay, only larger(6-7 feet) and thus more inclined to 
mixing heavier tactics in with guerrilla styles. 
</p>

<h3>Alfiq</h3>
<p>
appear to be house cats. Apparently they cannot speak normally, but can 
understand spoken language. 
They are reputed to have magical abilities and be used as spies and saboteurs. 
</p>

<h3>Pahmar</h3>
<p>
are jaguar to tiger sized, swift and vicious. They are best suited to stealth 
kills, especially in forests where they can drag the victims into the trees. 
</p>

<h3>Senche</h3>
<p>
Roughly the same height as the average Altmer, with an average weight comparable to that of twenty Altmer. 
Their forelimbs are thick and half again as long as their rears, giving them an apelike appearance. 
They are most effective as intelligent tanks against lightly armed and armored 
opponents who are easy to maul and trample while the Senche riders shoot and spear.

<p>
Maybe: a "save your character" option, but how? DB, JSON file, HTML file? 
I think JSON fits in with the JS use but how make sure input is clean? 
I know how to do such in PHP but not JS, don't want Bobby Tables. 
</p>
<p>
MAYBE: instead of "roles", let choose 6 or 7 skills, although that'll be harder- 
will have to figure out how to limit the input. Also how to do the JS.
