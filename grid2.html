                We can use grid now! If everyone is using Chrome and Firefox. 
                That they updated recently. Otherwise it'll be oh 2022 before we can. 
                Time to look up fallback techniques. And how to use it in IE. Ugh. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Supporting IE/Edge would mean effectively doubling all grid code with prefixed versions. 
                And bug hunting. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I think this would work for news/blog or shopping layout, both are basically 
                articles with a header, text content, and image. Tho now it's popular 
                to have an image with the text on top of it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've got some examples for simple layouts here, have yet to think of 
                something complicated yet logical. So far it just seems to be a replacement 
                for Bootstrap etc. 
                If you could get interactivity going it might 
                have some nifty use, like choosing options when ordering a pizza?

                    I think flexbox could get the same effect since this is a simple 
                    layout, but grid feels more precise.

                    After some mucking about, having the image beside 
                    the text would limit to 2 columns. But moving to top like the 
                    BBC news would elminate need for grid. Hmm. OK toss third, 
                    leave rest as example of grid-in-grid.
