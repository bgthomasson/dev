"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was also a powerful sorceress.  
All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good."

<p>
Zero is 0 and capital "o" is O. 0O0O0O. Numeral one is 1 and lowercase L is l. 1l1l1l1l. 
ZERO. Z3r0. lollypop. 1011yp0p. #010101. 
</p>
<p>
Similar to Fira Mono and DejaVu Sans Mono, they all use the the hooked l and the dotted 0. 
Honestly I like the l best but prefer the slashed zero *shrugs*.

Similar to Consolas which is a good default in Windows but exclusive there.

Similar to Consolas, but has a retro typewriter look which I find appealing and readable.
