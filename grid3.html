                Crazy fun stuff! Look at it go! Just relax and let it flow. 
                That easy. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks 
                for the easiest way to do things. See how easy it is to create a 
                little tree right in your world. You got your heavy coat out yet? 
                It's getting colder. Very easy to work these to death. 
                A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.

                Woo so exciting. So eye catching. Much interest. 
                Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build 
                the framework first. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. 
                In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. 
                Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

                    I think flexbox could get the same effect since this is a simple 
                    layout, but grid feels more precise.
