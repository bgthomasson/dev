/* Originally each tile had specific grid location but left ugly gaps. 
* https://medium.com/deemaze-software/css-grid-responsive-layouts-and-components-eee1badd5a2f
* This is a good tutorial on fixing that and simplifies everything. 
* Ideally this is all auto-gen server side so no time for that fussy amount of detail. 
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit
* object-fit: cover will cause the image to expand to cover the entire box but may stretch or clip. 
* object-fit: contain will maintain the aspect ratio, but this again leaves random gaps. 
* (at least now though it's more flexible)
