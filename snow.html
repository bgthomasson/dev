                    Mucking around with simple layouts, trying the old "blog with sidebar", 
                    only this is using grid. Interesting but not sure if I want to use yet.

                    For mobile, the footer is visible and has a link that'll scroll back 
                    up to the top of the page. On desktop, the sidebar is fixed so 
                    no need for a footer. Also you can hit HOME on the keyboard.

                    This plain white is rather dull but the purpose is the layout.

                    Let's have a little bit of fun today. 
                    Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. 
                    I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. 
                    Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.

                    Snow refers to forms of ice crystals that precipitate from the 
                    atmosphere (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the 
                    Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water 
                    throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, 
                    the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter 
                    size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose 
                    in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. 
                    Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of 
                    atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around 
                    particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water 
                    droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes 
                    take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, 
                    needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, 
                    it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, 
                    by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate 
                    is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. 
                    Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff 
                    into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.
