        Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court 
        for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum 
        security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by 
        the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem 
        and no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-team.

        A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. It just happens - 
        whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Every highlight 
        needs it's own personal shadow. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let all 
        these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. You can't 
        have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.
