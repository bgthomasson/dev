BUG LIST ---------------------------------------------------------------------|

HI: modern browsers (as of 2015)
LO: obscure Linux stuff, IE8/9/10, etc
NO: IE6 etc. 

1. FLEXBOX
A. Not available in older browsers 
Suggested fix: some fallback CSS to keep it usable, low level to-do list
Also add in -webkit versions?
Cynical fix: for those at work, a link to download portable firefox! 
that's still a thing right? Oh it is!

B. Not a final version as of 2015, so may have some odd behavior
Suggested fix: wait for complaints so know what to fix...
bug hunting bounty??? 


C. IE 11 misplaces everything when the browser is shrunk below 500px, even when 
try some of this- https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs
Suggested fix: ??? I don't have time for this! 
Cynical fix: hope nobody notices??
