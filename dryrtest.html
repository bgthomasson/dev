        This is just the style test, not writing a site top to bottom. 
        I like it enough to use for my own personal blog type thing.         
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>IE 11 (Windows 7, and good enough to need little special care)</li>
        <li>Firefox 38 (long term release)</li>
        <li>Chrome 40 (round number)</li>
        <li>Safari 8</li>
        <li>Android 4.x</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol>
        <li>CSS/HTML: multi/mixed media posting</li>
        <li>CSS/JS: Emote buttons need efficient JS</li>
        <li>The only JS should be for dynamic buttons on articles and the message/mail link.</li>
        <li>?: include Prism? Adds 14.5kb JS and 2kb CSS</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Bare HTML/CSS loads in under 200ms on DSL (according to Chrome at least), so I think 
    I can relax about that for now. Using the minimized unified file so will stop 
    picking at it.

    For an actual website there would be thumbnails with a predetermined size. 
    Doing perfect mixed multimedia should be number one on to-do list. 
    Also note FF expands the content container around the image but Chrome doesn't. 
    </p>
    <p>That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. 
    You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Everybody needs a friend. 
    You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.</p>

    <p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. 
    This is happy place, little squirrels live here and play. There are no limits in this world. 
    That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. I like to beat the brush.</p>

    <p class="leader">At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start.  
    The passengers took their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling-cloaks.  
    The two great sails were hoisted, and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened 
    snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour.</p>

    <p>The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is at most two hundred miles.  
    If the wind held good, the distance might be traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the 
    sledge might reach Omaha by one o'clock.</p>

    <p>What a journey!  The travellers, huddled close together, could not speak for the cold, 
    intensified by the rapidity at which they were going.  The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over 
    the waves.  When the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground by 
    its sails.  Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a straight line, and by a turn of his hand checked 
    the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make.  All the sails were up, and the jib was so 
    arranged as not to screen the brigantine.  A top-mast was hoisted, and another jib, 
    held out to the wind, added its force to the other sails.  Although the speed could not be exactly 
    estimated, the sledge could not be going at less than forty miles an hour.</p>
