    <p class="leader">At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start.  
    The passengers took their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling-cloaks.  
    The two great sails were hoisted, and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened 
    snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour.</p>

    <p>The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is at most two hundred miles.  
    If the wind held good, the distance might be traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the 
    sledge might reach Omaha by one o'clock.</p>

    <p>What a journey!  The travellers, huddled close together, could not speak for the cold, 
    intensified by the rapidity at which they were going.  The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over 
    the waves.  When the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground by 
    its sails.  Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a straight line, and by a turn of his hand checked 
    the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make.  All the sails were up, and the jib was so 
    arranged as not to screen the brigantine.  A top-mast was hoisted, and another jib, 
    held out to the wind, added its force to the other sails.  Although the speed could not be exactly 
    estimated, the sledge could not be going at less than forty miles an hour.</p>
