> ability score and modifiers
??? should I do roll 4d6 which is fairly simple
OR do the point buy, it's more customizable but will need 
1. incremental thingies to scroll numbers
2. instant AJAX to add and subtract from total points allowed (7 is -4, 17 is +13)
so all the scrollers start at 10 (cost of 0) and has box w/ remaining points
! would have to stop user if try to go past... 
!! also have to factor in racial stats!! so this func would have to reuse 
the radio btn check....
set the abilities at 10, then run that to add/sub. 


 
> alignment gets some influence, e.g. evil unicorns are vampiric not healers
not sure how to set this up cleanly
> also barbarians can't be lawful! how handle?






stripChars(input){
  var angles = /[<>]/g;
  input.replace(angles, "_");
}

Whoa cool
A generator, once more, only this has various rules of grammar and phonetics 
you can feed in a sample of you fictional language and it'll generate either
- more new words
- evolve the language by choosing random mutations




DUMB but funny IDEA
a password generator that's a cat walking on a keyboard
