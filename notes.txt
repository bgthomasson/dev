not sure how to set this up cleanly
> barbarians can't be lawful! how handle?

> alt racial traits
> favored class bonuses
> archetypes 
> ranger has animal companion!




--------------
OK I want a jquery style $() thingy that's a shorthand for document.getElementById

bonus: one line it, instead of
var a = $('elid');
b.textContent = a.value;

which is really how I'd do in PHP, run the input value through strip_tags() etc
which we'd only need to do for name input, BUT doing double checks to make sure 
radio buttons are selected etc is mandatory. eventually. 

I want something like
b.textContent = $('elid').value;

Whoa cool
A generator, once more, only this has various rules of grammar and phonetics 
you can feed in a sample of you fictional language and it'll generate either
- more new words
- evolve the language by choosing random mutations




DUMB but funny IDEA
a password generator that's a cat walking on a keyboard
