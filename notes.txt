DESIGN NOTES___________________________________________________________________

Khajiit to Pathfinder
convert "role" to class and "morph" to race, easy. 
change attributes and skills to match pathfinder, easy but laborious. 

series 1 will have limited details to preserve sanity. 
races: human, dwarf, orc, kobold, tengu; kernuni, yuanren, bovini 
just a sample, can add more as needed. focus on architecture. 

harder: 
will need to ROLL for HP and main 6 attributes 
and att modifier will add to skills
this is just to do rough grunt work then copy to paper so skip some inputs 
! for human they can choose to increase any ability modifier! hmm. 

> needs to mark your class skills! if skill = primarySkill then style = something

on the skills, will need to do a LOOP that prints out 
$skillName, $totalbonus, $abilityModifier, $miscModifier

Whoa cool
A generator, once more, only this has various rules of grammar and phonetics 
you can feed in a sample of you fictional language and it'll generate either
- more new words
- evolve the language by choosing random mutations
