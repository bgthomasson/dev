Khajiit to Pathfinder
convert "role" to class and "morph" to race, easy. 
change attributes and skills to match pathfinder, easy but laborious. 

series 1 will have limited details to preserve sanity. 
races: human, dwarf, orc, kobold, tengu; kernuni, yuanren, bovini 
just a sample, can add more as needed. focus on architecture. 

harder: 
will need to ROLL for HP and main 6 attributes 
and att modifier will add to skills
this is just to do rough grunt work then copy to paper so skip some inputs 
! for human they can choose to increase any ability modifier! hmm. 

> needs to mark your class skills! if skill = primarySkill then style = something

on the skills, will need to do a LOOP that prints out 
$skillName, $totalbonus, $abilityModifier, $miscModifier

Note: because of reserved words I can't really use "class" as a variable. 

It's really frustrating, either I do it all inline in JS like old khajiit thing, 
so have HUGE file there, or do it all inline in HTML and hope I can autogen efficiently, 
it's all so much typing and potential for typos and clusterfuk. 

for the attributes it seems simple enough to do textContent but for the skills 
it seems it would keep things cleaner to do innerHTML so won't have to keep 
bouncing between files to double check what abbr I used

to get the ability modifier, need like a crossjoin database, mark which skill 
is connected to which attribute and then pull the modifier M from the db/array

will need loop to set modifier! and not like a case statement either, something 
programmatic, automatic, and values <10 need negatives
also hard minimum of 1 or 0 when rolling stats.... 

yes. two values. set default skill value like 'acro', when do race and such, 
you modify -that- one, output as skill_misc_output
-then- automagically pull ability mod and insert as skill_am_output

a class skills array? start it empty, then like kobold always has traps and stealth, 
we push into the array as we go, 

var skillArray = [];

skillArray.push("craft trapmaking");

wow this is going to take so much typing...









--------------
OK I want a jquery style $() thingy that's a shorthand for document.getElementById

bonus: one line it, instead of
var a = $('elid');
b.textContent = a.value;

which is really how I'd do in PHP, run the input value through strip_tags() etc
which we'd only need to do for name input, BUT doing double checks to make sure 
radio buttons are selected etc is mandatory. eventually. 

I want something like
b.textContent = $('elid').value;

Whoa cool
A generator, once more, only this has various rules of grammar and phonetics 
you can feed in a sample of you fictional language and it'll generate either
- more new words
- evolve the language by choosing random mutations




DUMB but funny IDEA
a password generator that's a cat walking on a keyboard
