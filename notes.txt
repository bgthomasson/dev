DESIGN NOTES___________________________________________________________________
OUTLINE
. miniquery for button
. health stuff, 
^ getHealthy()
. attributes
. misc speed etc
. skills vars, arrays
^ generateCharacterSheet()


MAJOR:

> ability score and modifiers
let's put this in a different file, in the form have a button to roll before
submit form, so can pick out what like, use the textContent to ajax it. 
can you do that? not really a form inside a form, just a button and output table

??? should I do roll 4d6 which is fairly simple
OR do the point buy, it's more customizable but will need 
1. incremental thingies to scroll numbers
2. instant AJAX to add and subtract from total points allowed (7 is -4, 17 is +13)
so all the scrollers start at 10 (cost of 0) and has box w/ remaining points
! would have to stop user if try to go past... 
!! also have to factor in racial stats!! so this func would have to reuse 
the radio btn check....
AHAh. set the abilities at 10, then run that to add/sub. 


> work out how to make a join db/array of ability mods and classes.
OR if I'm typing out the tmplate by hand I can just put in the correct $ability_mod 
hmmmm

> finish output

> ERROR CATCH RADIO BUTTONS


MINOR

> alignment gets some influence, e.g. evil unicorns are vampiric not healers
not sure how to set this up cleanly
> barbarians can't be lawful! how handle?

> alt racial traits
> favored class bonuses
> archetypes 
> ranger has animal companion!

KHAJIIT notes that affect this as well
1. RESET! running once, thne choosing new radio buttons and clicking again will 
simply pile on numbers, whooops. it seems to be aaving the previous selection 
and running that again on top of the new one, each time! 
oh I see the content isn't changing on race and role, hmm...
but it does on name! wtf. oh it gets output directly from the input. mhmm. 

so should be built in failsafe that resets each click of the button. right? 
ironically i think the problem is breaking the one big function up, trying 
to do it "right" just fucks everything up...

oh hey you can put functions inside functions... hmm... 



--------------
OK I want a jquery style $() thingy that's a shorthand for document.getElementById

bonus: one line it, instead of
var a = $('elid');
b.textContent = a.value;

which is really how I'd do in PHP, run the input value through strip_tags() etc
which we'd only need to do for name input, BUT doing double checks to make sure 
radio buttons are selected etc is mandatory. eventually. 

I want something like
b.textContent = $('elid').value;

Whoa cool
A generator, once more, only this has various rules of grammar and phonetics 
you can feed in a sample of you fictional language and it'll generate either
- more new words
- evolve the language by choosing random mutations




DUMB but funny IDEA
a password generator that's a cat walking on a keyboard
