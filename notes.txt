> ability score and modifiers
??? should I do roll 4d6 which is fairly simple
OR do the point buy, it's more customizable but will need 
1. incremental thingies to scroll numbers
2. instant AJAX to add and subtract from total points allowed (7 is -4, 17 is +13)
so all the scrollers start at 10 (cost of 0) and has box w/ remaining points
! would have to stop user if try to go past... 
!! also have to factor in racial stats!! so this func would have to reuse 
the radio btn check....
set the abilities at 10, then run that to add/sub. 


 
> alignment gets some influence, e.g. evil unicorns are vampiric not healers
not sure how to set this up cleanly
> also barbarians can't be lawful! how handle?

PHP
need: 
error handle form
 

I want to put race and class stuff into some sort of DB instead of just into 
page html becuase that way can CMS it, and also keep the radio options matching 
the output stuff, so one source of data, sent to many functions.

shit I just realized the best way to do it is have a generic template 
that can handle pathfinder, khajiit, etc.  


form: RACE and CLASS should be template, pull from DB in loop, func for both 
race and class like 
generate_radios($purpose)


not sure about ability selector thing but using JS to change for race etc 
sounds cool still



output_skills()
grab selected radio buttons
use db crossjoin to get ability mods for each skill 
do math for race etc to get the misc skill mods 
do math to add both of these to return as default skill level
shit- does it need a way to let user add points as well?

subroutine 
if class skill then add tr class='class-skill'
main routine
print "<tr> <td>$skill</td> <td>$ability_mod</td> <td>$skill_misc_mods</td> </tr>";

Whoa cool
A generator, once more, only this has various rules of grammar and phonetics 
you can feed in a sample of you fictional language and it'll generate either
- more new words
- evolve the language by choosing random mutations




DUMB but funny IDEA
a password generator that's a cat walking on a keyboard
