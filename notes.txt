> ability score and modifiers
??? should I do roll 4d6 which is fairly simple
OR do the point buy, it's more customizable but will need 
1. incremental thingies to scroll numbers
2. instant AJAX to add and subtract from total points allowed (7 is -4, 17 is +13)
so all the scrollers start at 10 (cost of 0) and has box w/ remaining points
! would have to stop user if try to go past... 
!! also have to factor in racial stats!! so this func would have to reuse 
the radio btn check....
set the abilities at 10, then run that to add/sub. 



> have input validation, at least basic, 
but need to put into own files to be super modular
 
> alignment gets some influence, e.g. evil unicorns are vampiric not healers
not sure how to set this up cleanly

> barbarians can't be lawful! how handle?




> modules
if have vars loose in file, they'll never reset when click button again... 




PHP/JSON version? 
have php handle all the form stuff, send back as JSON. temp save also.

Whoa cool
A generator, once more, only this has various rules of grammar and phonetics 
you can feed in a sample of you fictional language and it'll generate either
- more new words
- evolve the language by choosing random mutations




DUMB but funny IDEA
a password generator that's a cat walking on a keyboard
