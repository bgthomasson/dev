NOTES ON FN ETC

FN-
~USERPAGE
1. THUMBNAILS FOR FUCKS SAKE or at least low-bandwidth option
The userpage "stream" thing is cute but when you're on DSL, having the entire 
image load is frustrating. 
It's sort of like, IDK, the image is an extra large dragon dildo, and... you can guess the metaphor. 

2. drop text up top on # followers, just have icon/username and ART ART ART
2B. 'stream'- simply followed :icon:

3. COMMISSION INFO UP HIGH with links to alt sites
simply bio blurb, commission info, 

4. customer ratings/reviews?
