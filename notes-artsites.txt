NOTES ON FN ETC

FN-
~USERPAGE
1. THUMBNAILS FOR FUCKS SAKE or at least low-bandwidth option
The userpage "stream" thing is cute but when you're on DSL, having the entire 
image load is frustrating. 
It's sort of like, IDK, the image is an extra large dragon dildo, and... you can guess the metaphor. 

2. drop text up top on # followers, just have icon/username and ART ART ART
2B. 'stream'- simply followed :icon:

on second thought this whole activity stream is stupid, I want to focus on ART



3. COMMISSION INFO UP HIGH with links to alt sites
simply bio blurb, commission info, 

4. customer ratings/reviews?


STRUCTURE

site-nav, sicky at top of page
userpage-nav, for interacting w/ user, watch, message, block
userpage-banner, thumbnails from gallery like weasyl
userpage-info-commissions


<h1 class="nomen"><a href="studio-userpage.html">Sitename</a></h1>

I can't find a good way to pt this in the main nav bar @.@;



NAV
ART has posted arts, images, music, etc.
MESSAGES has journals, streams, commission alerts, pms, etc
SUBMIT is obvious
SETTINGS is dropdown w/ link to various things
HELP as acutal user manual!
SFW! is boss button, smash to hide titties and weiners
