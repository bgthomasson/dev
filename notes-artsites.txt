NOTES 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
main page
browse page / gallery page
userpage
item page


------------------
need a way to resize images on smaller screen. it gets smooshed when set 
width="500" 
dynamic resize based on screen size sounds messy 




------------------
STRUCTURE

site-nav, sicky at top of page
userpage-nav, for interacting w/ user, watch, message, block
userpage-banner, thumbnails from gallery like weasyl
userpage-info-commissions


<h1 class="nomen"><a href="studio-userpage.html">Sitename</a></h1>


NAV
ART has posted arts, images, music, etc.
MESSAGES has journals, streams, commission alerts, pms, etc
SUBMIT is obvious
SETTINGS is dropdown w/ link to various things
HELP has actual user manual!
SFW! is boss button, smash to hide titties and weiners




multi image submissions

can organize gallery into custom folders

fully multimedia text- maybe use markdown, so can embed images- 
maybe submit images on own, then embed in story where needed to illustrate
only have to make it so can only use thing you've submitted or collected! 
cuz thieves would ruin this.

can "collect" stuff done for you 
can review artist on things you collect, give starts, write up blurb 

regular journals for status updates, but also stream alerts and for sale signs. 

groups- granular privacy like LJ did

granular watches/faves- clean vs kinky- like folders, like Gmail! 
faves: sort into folders like gallery
inbox: like GMail inbox, have clean on top, then adult, (and custom options?)

can reblog like FN, tumblr, so a tab for that in the inbox


realtime dm/pm

blocklist

clean userpage, no stats, no pageviews, just ART on top 
(maybe have a view more button? load in page??? instead of dedicated gallery)
then commission info, if have
then bio info, watchlists


need to economize width over 800 px, make 2 col? 
thumb strip---------
commission | personal
