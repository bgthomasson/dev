    <h3>I found a sick or injured animal, what do I do?</h3>
    <p>
    In the city of Marshall, call 903-935-4530 and ask for a Marshall Animal Control Officer. 
    These officers respond to calls concerning dangerous animals, injured or dead animals, stray animals, 
    abandoned animals, and animal cruelty. The officers may not go out of the city limits of Marshall. 
    If Animal Control is not available, call the Marshall Police Department 
    and they will either respond or contact Animal Control. 
    </p>
    <p>
    You should call the Harrison County Sheriff’s Office to report animal 
    cruelty cases outside the city of Marshall (903-923-4000). 
    The city of Waskom also has a very active Animal Control Officer who can 
    be reached at 903-687-2293. 
    </p>
    <p>Maybe a helpful blurb about how to take care of the animal till then would be nice.</p>
    <p>
        Hey you know what would help? LOST AND FOUND BOARD. Even if have to use 
        Facebook group or something. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An image of the building DOWN HERE because I want the contact info to be 
        on TOP, the first thing you see. Also since this is aimed at mobile, keep 
        images BELOW 100kb. Also the county is mostly rural with DSL at home. 
        So the bare site itself is ~10kb and loads in two seconds max, the images 
        shouldn't take more than a minute to load.

    The HSHC is a private non-profit organization dedicated to homeless animal 
    adoption, pet care education, and pet spay/neuter assistance. HSHC is funded 
    only by donations, memberships, and fund-raising activities. The Marshall 
    Animal Shelter is a tax-paid city department, charged with the responsibility 
    of taking in stray and unwanted animals in Harrison County, picking up stray 
    animals within the city limits of Marshall, and enforcing animal-related 
    ordinances and laws within the city. [Insert their contact info here!]
