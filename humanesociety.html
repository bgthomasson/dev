    <h3>I found a sick or injured animal, what do I do?</h3>
    <p>
    In the city of Marshall, call 903-935-4530 and ask for a Marshall Animal Control Officer. 
    These officers respond to calls concerning dangerous animals, injured or dead animals, stray animals, 
    abandoned animals, and animal cruelty. The officers may not go out of the city limits of Marshall. 
    If Animal Control is not available, call the Marshall Police Department 
    and they will either respond or contact Animal Control. 
    </p>
    <p>Maybe a helpful blurb about how to take care of the animal till then would be nice.</p>
    <p>
    You should call the Harrison County Sheriff’s Office to report animal 
    cruelty cases outside the city of Marshall (903-923-4000). 
    The city of Waskom also has a very active Animal Control Officer who can 
    be reached at 903-687-2293.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>What does the HSHC do?</h3>
    <p>
    This should be a simple bullet point with photos- spay/neuter assistance, 
    vaccinations, etc. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>What is the difference between HSHC and Marshall Animal Shelter?</h3>
    <p>
    The HSHC is a private non-profit organization dedicated to homeless animal 
    adoption, pet care education, and pet spay/neuter assistance. HSHC is funded 
    only by donations, memberships, and fund-raising activities. The Marshall 
    Animal Shelter is a tax-paid city department, charged with the responsibility 
    of taking in stray and unwanted animals in Harrison County, picking up stray 
    animals within the city limits of Marshall, and enforcing animal-related 
    ordinances and laws within the city. [Insert their contact info here!]
