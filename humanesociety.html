    <h3>I found a sick or injured animal, what do I do?</h3>
    <p>
        In the city, call  and ask for Animal Control Officer. These officers 
        respond to calls concerning dangerous animals, injured or dead animals, 
        stray animals, abandoned animals, and animal cruelty. The officers may 
        not go out of the city limits. If Animal Control is not available, call 
        the Police Department and they will either respond or contact Animal Control. 
        You should call the County Sheriffâ€™s Office to report animal cruelty cases outside the city. 
    </p>
    <p>Maybe a helpful blurb about how to take care of the animal till then would be nice.</p>
    <p>
        Hey you know what would help? LOST AND FOUND BOARD. Even if have to use 
        Facebook group or something. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An image of the building DOWN HERE because I want the contact info to be 
        on TOP, the first thing you see. Also since this is aimed at mobile, keep 
        images BELOW 100kb. Also the county is mostly rural with DSL at home. 
        So the bare site itself is ~10kb and loads in two seconds max, the images 
        shouldn't take more than a minute to load.

        A part-time facility director is the only paid personnel of the Society. 
        Volunteers make the Society a viable and meaningful part of local animal welfare. 
        Insert a cheerful blurb that encourages people to be interested.
